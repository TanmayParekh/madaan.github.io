title: Everyone Can Write Bad Code
---


### It's Simpler than You Think

Writing bad code is simpler than you think. Yada-yadas will make you believe that it takes special skills to write bad code, that only a "chosen few" among us are capable of doing it. They may trick you into thinking that it takes a lot of apathy, the ability to hand wave, the special gut feeling to make bad assumptions, and a keen, sharp focus on the short term (or smaller picture). Sounds like a lot, doesn't it?

Well, to tell you the truth, it's not that hard. For those of help who strive to write poor code, with a special focus on screwing up on _big data_ jobs, I have compiled a set of action items that will help you in starting on this journey. If you read carefully, you will realize that there are people around you whom you had mocked as _good_ developers, or had even given them the occassional sledging by calling them _uber_ developers have actually done a few of these things now and then.



### 0. Don't Unit Test

### 1. Don't Waste Time Thinking About Names

### 2. Documentation is Useless

### 3. Either Comment Nowhere, or Comment Everywhere

### 4. If You Think it Will Work, it Will Work

### 5. Early Optimization is Evil so Write Stupid Code

### 6. Head start: Start Coding Before You Know What's to be Done

### 7. Specifications less than 100 pages are useless

### 8. The First Test should be on a Billion Lines, in Distributed Mode

### 9. Your Work is Good Enough to Live on _master_ branch at All Times

### A. No One Can Review Your Code Once It's Written, Ideally Not Even You

### B. `hugeData.flatMap().reduceByKey().groupByKey().map(_.toString)` throws OOM, Spark must be a fad.

### C. Big O Matters for People In School taking Algorithms Courses

### D. If The Job Finished, the Data has to be Right

### E. If the Job Crashes on a 100 Cores, All You Need is 200 Cores

### F. Never look at the Data
