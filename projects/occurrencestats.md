### Objective

- To estimate the ratio of Entities in a given text corpus using maximum mean discrepancy.

- Used existing named entity disambiguators for feature extraction and libsvm for benchmarking and comparison.

- Although the experiments I performed showed that SVMs performed better than MMD for ratio estimation of entities, the seminar lead to a useful survey report of the problem of named entity disambiguation techniques and MMD.

### Results/Report

- The survey report is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04359).

- Results from the experiments are available [here](https://madaan.github.io/res/papers/mmdentity.pdf).
