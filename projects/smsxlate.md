- While translating English to Hindi is no small feat, the number of challenges involved drastically increase when the input is not in standard English, but is English text written in SMS style abbreviated form, like "hw r u?". The goal of this task was to translate such an input to the corresponding hindi translation: "आप कैसे हैं?"

- The translation pipeline included transliteration, spell correction, text normalization and compression. The translator was wrapped around an Android app. We obtained _very good_ results! 

- Checkout [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/madaan/madaan.github.io/raw/master/res/presentations/smsxlate.pdf){:target="_blank"} for methodology and results.

- The project was supervised by [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) in collaboration with [Naman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naman-gupta-a057624b/?originalSubdomain=jp).
